<h1>Elevator Pitch</h1>
<p>“I’m a certified Salesforce Administrator with 4+ years delivering 25–40% efficiency gains across Sales and Service Cloud. In regulated environments like Stryker and MetLife, I built robust validation, auditability, and document automation with Conga and Adobe Sign. For clinical trials, I bring a data‑integrity‑first approach aligned to ALCOA+, a security model that protects PHI, and hands‑on experience operationalizing complex approval/signature workflows. I translate protocol requirements into scalable configuration and dashboards that improve recruitment, retention, and compliance—so I can be productive on day one.”</p>
