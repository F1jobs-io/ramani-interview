<h1>LabConnect — Research Plan & Open Questions</h1>
<p>We’ll validate specifics as soon as we have permission to research public sources or receive official materials.</p>

<h2>To Validate</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Core services and where Salesforce supports those (sales vs ops vs support).</li>
  <li>Current Salesforce footprint: Sales/Service Clouds, CPQ? Conga? CLM status.</li>
  <li>Adjacent systems: EDC/CTMS/LIMS and finance; current integration patterns.</li>
  <li>Security posture: PHI access strategy, audit trail expectations, change control.</li>
  <li>Hiring process specifics: number of rounds, practical exercise, decision timeline.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Questions for Recruiter/HM</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Which teams are the primary Salesforce users today (Sales, Contracts, Ops)?</li>
  <li>What are the top 3 pain points driving the clean-up project?</li>
  <li>Do you use CPQ for milestone-based pricing? Which document flows run on Conga?</li>
  <li>What integrations are planned (EDC/CTMS/LIMS/Finance)? Timelines?</li>
  <li>What does success in the first 90 days look like? What’s the conversion bar?</li>
  <li>How do you run change control/UAT in a regulated context (Part 11 awareness)?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Collateral to Prepare</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1-page cheat sheet: elevator pitch, metrics, clean-up plan.</li>
  <li>Deck snippet: before/after dashboards (redacted), Conga flow diagram.</li>
  <li>Validation/UAT sample: traceability matrix snippet and test script example.</li>
</ul>
